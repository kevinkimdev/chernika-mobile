## Setup
1. Install node and bower dependencies: `npm install` 'bower install'
2. Build configs, styles etc.: `gulp build`
3. Add some platform, for example Android: `cordova platform add ios`
4. Type 'ionic run android'
5. We used cordova 5.3.3, if you have older version try updating it `npm install -g cordova` (may require sudo)

## Features
#### Gameplay
* 100 different levels. (If you think the first 20 is too easy, yeah it's true. Go straight to the 4-th and 5-th chapter and let's see how long would it take for you to finish them :) ).
* Neat UI
* Responsive design
* Autosave feature

I didn't add bootstrap, because I think it's overwhelming for such small project

#### Technical stuff
* Ionic
* Sass
* Ionic tinder cars
* Websockets chats
* Geolocation
* Push notifications
* VK integration
* Google analytics integrated
* Hardware accelerated CSS3 animations
